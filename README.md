This repository contains all of my machine learning projects. Each project is contained in its own directory, and includes the following:

- A `README.md` file that provides an overview of the project, including the problem being solved, the approach taken, and the results obtained.
- A `notebook` or a `.py` file that contains the code used to train and evaluate the model.
- Any additional data or resources required to run the code.

## **Prerequisites**

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (if the project is in notebook format)
- The following Python libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
  - Six
  - TensorFlow (if the project uses TensorFlow)
  - Keras (if the project uses Keras)
  - PyTorch (if the project uses PyTorch)
